For this Lab4 assignment, having done an initial requirements/usecase analysis and identified the main use-cases for your project, you will now perform further analysis for each of your Use-cases, and create/produce Sequence diagrams for 2 or 3 of the major, significant use-cases. You may use, the example on slide 30 of the lesson7 lecture slides, as a guide.

Make sure to use a suitable UML diagramming tool for creating your Sequence diagrams (e.g. www.draw.io, StarUML or Enterprise Architect etc). Also, make sure to identify and indicate the Analysis classes (i.e. Entity, Control and/or Boundary class) involved in each use-case, on each of your sequence diagrams.

Submit your sequence diagrams.

Enjoy!
