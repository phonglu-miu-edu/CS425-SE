For this Lab2 assignment, you are required to do the following:

1. Working in your project teams, apply the concepts, tools, and techniques learned in lessons 4 and 5, to perform a UseCase-driven Requirement Analysis for your course project, and produce a System Requirements Specification document for the project; which should include: the Use-Case model (i.e. use-case diagrams and use-case descriptions for the major use-cases you identify from the problem statement and your Vision document).

2. Download, setup and start using Git with Github for your project. Include the URL for your project repository on Github, in your SRS document. A detailed, step-by-step guide/tutorial for using Git with Github is provided for you here and here.

3. Begin preparing a short, 10-minute System Requirements/Design presentation, which you will upload later. This presentation can be done with Microsoft Powerpoint slides, showing your Requirements Analysis artifacts such the Use-Case model etc. Subsequently, you will be expected to add other artifacts from your further Analysis and Design  activities to complete the presentation and uploaded.

PS: An example Use Case description document is attached here, which you may use as a guide/reference, for creating yours.

Note: Make sure to be committing all your project output and resources to your git repository and regularly synch/push to your team's shared repository on Github.

Enjoy!
